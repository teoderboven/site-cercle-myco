See the section [The .env file](#the-env-file) for details about custom properties.

Use the following command to generate an encryption key:

```shell
php artisan key:generate
```

#### 2 - Migrate the database

## The .env file

> The *.env* file is used in projects to store configuration settings, environment variables, and sensitive information securely. It provides a convenient way to manage and organize various parameters that your project needs without hard-coding them directly into your code.

>[Sujatha Mudadla - medium.com](https://medium.com/@sujathamudadla1213/what-is-the-use-of-env-8d6b3eb94843)

An example of the .env file is provided in the directory. This is the [.env.example](.env.example) file.

Find below the description of property used for the CMB application:

### Determine the start date of a season

With the property **CMB_SEASON_START_DATE** you can specify when an activity season start. It is used in the /activity route to determine which activities to display.

Example:

```properties
# Season starts on February 1st
CMB_SEASON_START_DATE=02-01
```

The default value is February 1<sup>st</sup>. This means that activities for the 2025 season are publicly visible from February 1, 2025 to January 31, 2026. You can change the start of the season by modifying the property.

### Define the length of the Activities table id

The 'Activities' table in the database has an alphanumeric id. To determine the total id length, you can use the **CMB_ACTIVITY_ID_LENGTH** property.

Example:

```properties
# The 'Activities' table has an id lenght of 16 characters
CMB_ACTIVITY_ID_LENGTH=16
```

The default value is a length of 16 characters.

### Specify a cron secret key

**CRON_SECRET_KEY** is a secret key used to secure HTTP requests sent to the application by external services such as cron-job.org. This key is essential to validate incoming calls to specific routes that are performing scheduled tasks (for example, sending reminder emails). It ensures that only genuine requests from authorized sources can trigger these tasks.

The key is used in URLs so *it must be well formatted to avoid any errors*.

```properties
CRON_SECRET_KEY={aKeyYouDefine}
```

The key has no default value. ***It has to be configured***
